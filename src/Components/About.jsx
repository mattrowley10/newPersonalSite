        matter what. If not, then why be here? It was established thousands of
        years ago much more so than it is now. Our king, our gods led us to
        fight for what is right in the world and we would follow until our very
        deaths, attempting to achieve that purpose. Some do, some do not. Some
        die before they are able to, some live wondering if they can. The
        reality is that, with a higher purpose, we are destined for greatness
        whether or not we achieve what we saw in our own design. We live because
        that higher purpose demands it. */}
